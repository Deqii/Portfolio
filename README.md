# Full-Stack Developer

I am a **dedicated full-stack developer** specializing in modern web technologies like **React, Next.js, TypeScript**, and **Express**. My skill set extends across front-end development, where I create **responsive, dynamic interfaces** using CSS frameworks like **Tailwind**, to back-end development with database systems like **MySQL, MongoDB**, and **Prisma**.

### Key Projects:

- **Netflix Clone**: Integrated the **TMDB API** with **Firebase** for user authentication, showcasing my ability to build complete, functional applications.

As a **lifelong learner** in the tech industry, Iâ€™m always eager to explore new tools, frameworks, and methodologies to stay at the forefront of **web development**.
